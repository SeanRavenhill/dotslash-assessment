## Overview

### The challenge

Users should be able to:

Use the following to build the site:

1. Bootstrap 4+ (https://getbootstrap.com)
2. Font Awesome for Icons (https://fontawesome.com)
3. GitHub (https://github.com/) â€“ Add to GitHub/or Zip and send back so we can demo the site on our side.
4. Use any third-party jQuery/JS libraries you see fit.
5. Should be mobile friendly (Work for Desktop, Tablet AND Mobile)
6. You can add any features or functionality as you choose.

## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Bootstrap 5
- Custom Bootstrap 5 variables
- Sass & Dart-Sass
- FontAwesome
- Postcss Autoprefixer
- JSON
- Git and Github for version control
- Custom Vanilla Javascript
- Node Package Management
- Mobile-first workflow
- Figma

### What I learned

I familiarised myself with the Bootstrap v5 documentation and learned how to customise its variables and combine that with my own custom SASS CSS. 

I gained a better understanding of how to use NodeJS and Node Package Manager to install dependencies such as Dart-Sass, Postcss Autoprefixer and FontAwesome etc. 

I learned a great deal about how HTML and CSS can be written in a manner that allows for better collaboration between teams, using Bootstrap and its approach to utility classes. 

I also challenged myself to write my own custom Vanilla Javascript to control how the Carousel component which comes baked into Bootstrap, with my custom thumbnail gallery.

### Continued development and areas for improvement

You will notice that in my Navbar section, there is a small bug present where side-scrolling behaviour occurs when responsively controlling the browser window. I need to investigate how to address the issue where there is a lot of content required to be painted by the browser in the Navbar section, how it may be possible to have all items scale with the use of, perhaps, clamping properties. There is also some strange behaviour with the Boots Catalogue section. It behaves responsively and works well when I view the site on different devices in developer modes in both Chrome and Firefox. However, there are some bugs when controlling the browser window on a desktop or laptop screen, when scaling the window as thin as possible on the horizontal axis.

I ran out of time to experiment with the use of Modals, and engaging a full-screen gallery of the carousel images. Also, I need to investigate the off-canvas component features of Bootstrap, another feature I was not able to address due to time constraints.

In regards to my Javascript. I was very happy with what I did manage. However I need to learn how to control DOM elements using null objects (if this is indeed even possible), in this case, I wanted to add more functionality to the carousel and how it interacted with the thumbnail gallery when using the carousel indicators to control which image the carousel presented.

Certainly, look to get more practise with Bootstrap as I can see the great benefits it can provide once you are comfortable using it. I would also like to investigate the Tailwind framework.

### Useful resources

- [Patrick Muriungi - Youtube | FreeCodeCamp.org 
(Learn Bootstrap 5 and SASS by Building a Portfolio Website - Full Course)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iJKCj8uAHz8&t=441s&ab_channel=freeCodeCamp.org) - Patrick's course was an absolute gem! He is a great teacher and a lot of things made sense after I had reviewed his course. I particularly like the way he sets up Bootstrap for development and the development environment.
- [Scrimba - Learn Bootstrap for Free Course](https://scrimba.com/learn/bootstrap4) - A short and easy course that helps with some basic and fundamental concepts used in Bootstrap.
- [FreeCodeCamp.org - Front End Development Libraries (Bootstrap)](https://www.freecodecamp.org/learn/front-end-development-libraries/#bootstrap) - Another short and easy course that can get you up and running with the basics of Bootstrap quickly.
- [Bootstrap Website - Official Documentation](https://getbootstrap.com/) - When in doubt read the manual. Then read it again! It really helped me out when I got stuck on some things.
